# Oweland House

- Home of [[eda-oweland]]
- Owned by the Owelands for generations
- Sprawling, constantly under construction
- Family takes in fishers in hard times
- The Owelands share their wealth and house, expanding as needed
- **RUMOR:** The mazelike interior has spawned rumors of hidden passages and secret chambers.
  - The family once smuggled, and hidden passages run under cellars to points out of town.
  - [[skerrin-wavechaser]] has discovered a few that even the Owelands don't know about.
