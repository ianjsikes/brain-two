(Using modified rules from [here](https://chaoticneutraldm.com/2020/01/31/playing-pelota-in-the-hidden-shrine-of-tamoachan/))
Long corridor w/ goals at each end. Pelota ball floats in air halfway through.
WIN: Party scores one goal, then door in northern end opens.
LOSE: Each time opponents score goal, magic missiles (1d4+1). Party can retreat but they eventually have to win.

OPPONENTS: Spectral athletes (1 for each PC). Can't be hurt.
Only North/South movement matters. Teams take turns, not individuals.
TURNS:
One contender holds the ball. They can pass and then move.
To pass: pick a target, then make Athletics check. If beat DC 12, ball travels 5d6+15 feet. Otherwise, only 5d6. If teammate is within range, it succeeds, otherwise it falls to ground.
After a pass, you can move north or south your speed.
After successful pass, opposing team can move towards ball holder. and make contested Athletics check to grab.
After unsuccessful pass, opposing team can move towards ball and grab.
Either way, now opposing team takes turn.

To score, roll same as for a pass but DC 15. If you fail DC, it falls short or lands next to goal.
