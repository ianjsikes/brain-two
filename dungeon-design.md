# Dungeon Design

## Multiple entrances & exits
- Prevents railroady feel
- A few fairly obvious ones, and a couple secret ones
- Don't have to take same path on multiple trips
- Add info to entrance about what to expect down that path

## Why was it built?
- If it is a REAL dungeon, the layout would be different than an abandoned fortress
- should solve some of the design questions based on its intended purpose

## Levels
- Easy way to distribute difficulty with a clear guide to players

## Loops
- Avoid making dungeon linear or tree-like
- Allows players to uncover slowly rather than go down the railroad
- Similar concept as multiple entrances
- Adds interesting retreat/chase elements to combat

## Verticality
- Literally a new dimension
- Makes exploring a lot more fun

## Secret Areas
- Although they might not be discovered, it is worthwhile
- Should be well concealed, but with some vague clue.
- Makes players feel very rewarded when discovered.

## Room Type variety
- Don't use all rectangles
- Shape, verticality.
- Architectural motifs (pillars, bricks, etc)
  
## Tactically Useful Areas
- Chokepoints, High grounds
- Have a fight start _elsewhere_, and players can choose to move it to the tactical Areas

## Spying Opportunities
- Players need to have info to make interesting decisions.
- Areas where players can gain info from npcs
- Portcullises, one-way mirrors, echoey chambers

# Summary
All of these are about giving the players information and the opportunity to make interesting, informed decisions.
