# Town of Saltmarsh

## Brief History
Saltmarsh has been ravaged by pirates in the past. The king has turned focus to the town and is hoping to expand it. Additionally, a band of dwarves sanctioned by the king are excavating the surrounding hills for precious metals.

Some of the residents of the town are not happy about the sudden developments. They want things to remain the same. Also the Scarlet Brotherhood are sewing discord.

## Overview
About 5000 mostly human residents. Dwarves and halflings are normal, with about 200 dwarves. Elves are rare and face some discrimination as they have a reputation in the area as pirates.

## Law and Order

### Militia
One hundred trained warriors serve in the guard. Leather armor marked with the green reed of Saltmarsh, and a club.
Work in pairs, operating from two guardhouses near the road. Smaller station near the docks.
Captain of the guard is [[eliander-fireborn]]
Guard patrols the surrounding area on horseback with chainmail and longswords/crossbows.
A militia of 500 can be mustered up. Have minimal training.
A marine force can take to the sea against pirates. Led by a married couple, Tom and Will Stoutly.
The guards are seen as a meddlesome force, drawn from military veterans and thugs.

### Local Law Enforcement
Most cases, criminals pay a fine and let go. Sometimes have to work off the debt on construction. Town council can hold trials.

- **Petty Crime** brawling, pickpocketing, up to 50gp in property damages. Pay a fine of 2d6gp or one day of labor per gold.
- **Minor Crime** armed assault, nonfatal attacks, 50-250gp in damages. 100gp fine and 1d4 years in prison or labor.
- **Major Crime** More severe (murder, etc.). 2d10 years imprisonment, or death. Most trials take place in Seaton, east of Saltmarsh.

## Commerce

The city is pretty wealthy. Fishing grounds are very rich. Trading and smuggling.
Mines promise to rapidly increase wealth. Fishers fear competition.

### Fishing
Most of town works in fishing. Wealthier families own their own boats. Poorer families work as deck-hands. Difficult and dangerous, but they save up to buy their own boat. See newcomers as a threat to their hard work paying off.

### Trading
Wealthiest families own trading vessels. Most manufactured goods are imported into the town.

### Smuggling
Ideal market for illegal goods. Some boats meet smugglers at sea. Others do business at isolated points along the shore. Locals see no harm in smuggling.

### Mining
The mines are new. Locals are skeptic. They are finding silver and convinced their is gold. If they do, Saltmarsh will boom overnight.

## Docks
Recently had expansions for larger vessels. Two primary piers and a series of smaller ones.

Always busy. Guarded warehouses. Suspicious to be near them at night.

Hotbed of rumors. Sailors are bored and eager to share. See "Dock Rumors" table.
