# Saltmarsh Traditionalists

Alliance of fishers and merchants and townsfolk that do not like the crown's intervention. They do not want the king to engage in all-out pirate war. Some are smugglers themselves and do not want increased law enforcement. They don't want the dwarves' mine to succeed as it will diminish the focus on fishing and shipping.

The traditionalists are community-minded and want to return to the old way. They resent the king for abandoning them to the pirates and have since learned to fend for themselves.

Eda Oweland leads the traditionalists, with Gellan Primewater backing her up. Anders Solomor is unpredictable but typically sides with her.

The Traditionalists want everything to stay the same. Dwarves should go home, guards should stick with dealing with monsters, and the crown should go back to the north. The more things change, the more they protest.
