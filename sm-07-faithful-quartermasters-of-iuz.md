# Faithful Quartermasters of Iuz

A trade delegation lead by [[captain-xendros]]. Come to acquire large quantities of salted fish in the name of Iuz, a mighty cambion and demigod who rules the north. Their land does not produce enough food on its own. Saltmarsh is a major supplier.

Iuz is the enemy of Keoland's enemies, so they are good trade partners. They buy a LOT of fish, so nobody bugs them about being kinda spooky.
