**Personality:** Sunny and optimistic. Sees opportunity in every challenge. Too young to be realistic about risks.

**Ideal:** Freedom is the root of happiness. Pays well and wants to grow Saltmarsh. Hates the Sea Princes and wants to scour their slave trades from the earth.
**Bond:** Looks up to Petra above all else. His decisions are driven by a desire to live up to her standards. Skerrin uses this to drive him agains the Sea Princes.
**Flaw:** Na√Øve. Relied on his mother's expertise. This created a gap that Skerrin wormed into.
