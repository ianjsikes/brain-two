# Standing Stones

- Two enormous runestones on this island.
- In the past, a siren was chained to the stones and sacrificed by an evil human tribe in tribute to the sea. Since then, fishing has flourished.
  - The spirit was captured in the stones, and her song echos through the weave to draw fish to the area.
  - The siren's sisters and allies, among them powerful djinn, have scoured the planes in search of her spirit.
