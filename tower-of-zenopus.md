# Tower of Zenopus

- Once home to the wizard Zenopus.
- Built next to ancient graveyard.
- One night, tower engulved by fiery green aura.
  - Folks investigated and found it abandoned.
  - Door covered in strange symbols and wrapped in silver chains.
  - Tried to open, but a jolt of lighting struck.
  - After, spirits and fey wander around the top of the tower.
  - The town had it bombarded by a galleon until it was rubble
- [[keledek-the-unspoken]] used magic to open door and found hidden sea cave.
  - Uses the cave for smuggling. Several goblins watch over with a giant constrictor snake.
  - Goblins fight with ghouls and rats deeper down.
  - Keledek doesn't want to tell anyone about this, but is excited about unearthing Zenopus' lost secrets.
  - **HOOK:** May ask adventurers to explore if he trusts them.
