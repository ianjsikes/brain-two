# Keoland Loyalists

Newcomers from the north. Loyal to King Skotti. Want the town to be of value to the kingdom. The town guard, dwarves, and local farmers are loyalists.

Want security and law and order. Smuggling is bad. Believe in the law and the king. Want Saltmarsh to grow into a better place. Some look down on the citizens and see them as a barrier.

The loyalists are focused on two things: ensuring the mine is a success, and cracking down on smuggling to hurt the Sea Princes.
