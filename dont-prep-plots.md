# Don't Prep Plots

Notes from [this post][source] on The Alexandrian

Never prep a plot.
A plot is a series of events in a story.
Problem is, that is predetermining what happens, which is NOT what you do in an RPG.
A prepped thing should be something that leads to a story, not a story itself.

A _situation_ is a set of circumstances.

People want to prep plots because it feels easier to know 100% what will happen.
Its actually easier not to know EVERYTHING.
Plots will very quickly fall apart if players do anything different (butterfly effect kinda)

## THREE CLUE RULE

For any conclusion you want PCs to make, include at least three clues. Good chance they will not miss all three.
Ex: "Mickey Dee has a piece of info you need"

1. Knock him out and take it
2. Negotiate with him for it
3. Sneak into his office and steal it

## GOAL-ORIENTED OPPONENTS

Don't prep enemies' reaction to PC's actions because you can't predict their actions.
Just prep their _goals_, then react to how the PCs conflict w/ that.

## DON'T PLAN SPECIFIC CONTINGENCIES
