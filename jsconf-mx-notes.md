# JSConf MX Notes

Platform: hopin

## How is our topic?
Creative coding workshop, using React-three-fiber.
- Is this a good subject?
- Is anyone else already covering something similar?

## What is the format?
More like a twitch stream (one-way, only interact via chat)?
Or a zoom call (participants can talk too)?
Is there a possibility of breakout rooms to collab?

## How much time do we have?
Or how long should we aim for?
