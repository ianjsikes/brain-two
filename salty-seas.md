## rumors
- Somewhere along the dunwater river used to be an Alchemist's tower. It exploded, leaking strange alchemical agents into the water.
- The dwarven miners recently learned about the game of darts, and are obsessed.
- The Oweland Estate is full of secret passages used to sneak mistresses and other inconspicuous guests.
- East of the docks is a pile of dilapitated buildings swarming with crabs. More than one fisher has gone in and not come out.
- The crown dispatched a caravan with enough gold to commission six new warships. It went missing near the Hool Marshes.
- Drow traders posing as surface elves have been doing business in town.
- Someone's sabotaging fishing boats. It's those dwarves- they want to take over!
- The king's agents have infiltrated town. It's only a matter of time before they remove the council and replace them with foppish nobles.
- That tiefling who's looking to buy crocodile skulls can't be up to anything good.
- A couple of fishing boats have gone missing. If the sea devils aren't behind it, I'm a merman.
- A big critter's been going through everyone's trash at night. Something from the swamp, I'd reckon- maybe a troll.
- Sometimes on a moonless night, you can meet the ghost ofa drowned sailor trying to get home. Lead one to their home, and you'll get a wish. Fail, and they'll strangle you.
- If you see someone at the docks wearing a red cloak after dark, slip them a copper piece and they'll connect you with smugglers from beyond this world who can sell you anything you've dreamed of.
- It's only a matter of time before the dwarves dig too deep and unleash something horrible.
- Gellan Primewater's cook, Feliza, once cooked up and served a dwarf at one of his banquets.
- The abandoned house east of town used to belong to an alchemist. He knew how to turn metals into gold.
- If you speak his name, the town wizard can spy on your conversation.
- There's a vault under the Mining HQ full of dwarven artifacts.
- Sharkfin Bridge is warded against evil spirits.
- If you drink enough of Hanna Rist's Claw Wine, you can see in the dark.
