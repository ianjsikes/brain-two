# The Dwarven Anvil

- Blacksmith with a single anvil of dwarven origin
- Backlog ten miles long
- The (human) smiths make hooks, nails, harpoons, knives, fishing weights, and more.
- Master smith [[mafera-the-smith]] and [[jasker-the-smith]]
- A small shrine to Moradin is neglected under the eaves.

**HOOK:** Some of the new mining dwarves are suspicious of humans with fine dwarven tools. Might hire adventurers to break in and sneak off with any dwarven stuff.
