# Dunwater River

- Broad, slow-moving river empties into the Azure sea.
- Often too shallow for boats.
- Ideal grounds for bandits, with temporary forts.
- **RUMOR:** Somewhere along the river are the ruins of an alchemists tower. Exploded during an experiment, causing a large number of oozes to plague the river.
