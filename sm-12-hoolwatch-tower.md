# Hoolwatch Tower

60-foot tower. First defensive building in Saltmarsh. Serves as armory, lookout, and base for the town guard. [[eliander-fireborn]] spends most time here during his duties.

**HOOK:** Sometimes he needs adventurers, and posts jobs on a board by the tower's entrance (see job table).
