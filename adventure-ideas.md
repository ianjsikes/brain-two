# 2020-20-09 New Campaign Notes

## ⭐️ Some Homebrew Campaign
> Levels: Whatever you want

This is obviously the most vague category. It can really be whatever we want (except something extremely polished with a lot of fancy maps and stuff). We can pick the setting (Eberron with cool magitech, Ravenloft for spooOOOk factor, Dark Sun for weird post-apocalyptic, etc.). We can do whatever style of gameplay you like (politics! dungeon crawl! sprawling epic quests!). We can also mess around with other game systems... just throwing that out there.

Pros:
- We are for sure playing the type of game you want to be playing (assuming we communicate that properly).
- We can explore a setting or type of play that isn't really covered by any official book (why are there no official spelljammer adventures...)

Cons:
- No fancy maps or pre-made Roll20 content. I'll draw up maps when I can but they won't be _amazing_.
- Requires more work on my part. I am TOTALLY willing to do it IF yall are invested and excited about the flexibility of doing our own custom thing.

Random list of ideas:
- You run an inter-planar detective agency.
- A party of murder hobos is traveling the countryside causing havoc in search of loot. You are trying to stop them, and clean up their messes.
- An island appeared overnight a few mile offshore. You set out to build a town on it. Grow your settlement and protect it, and figure out where the island came from.
- You live in a dismal, low-magic world ruled by powerful sorcerers.  Try to infiltrate and liberate your land (basically Dorohedoro)
- Moon's haunted.

## ⭐️ Curse of Strahd
> Levels: 1-10 (or 5-10)

You are trapped in Barovia. Strahd (aka Dracula) is the lord of this demi-plane, and he wants to fuck you up. Wander around and fight werewolves, vampires, etc. while dancing around Strahd until you are powerful enough to take him on.

Pros:
- Very spooky, just in time for Halloween.
- Barovia is a cool, unique setting with lots of fun stuff like a spooky tarot deck mechanic that alters the story.
- You get to hear me do a dumb vampire voice.

Cons:
- Campaign is only levels 1-10. We can skip to level 5, but it probably won't last very long. Much of the tension of it is about being afraid of Strahd, so if you get too high-level, it sort of loses the horror aspect.
- You have to hear me do a dumb vampire voice.

## ⭐️ Dungeon of the Mad Mage
> Levels: 5-20

Underneath Waterdeep, through the Yawning Portal, lies a labyrinthine megadungeon known as Undermountain. It is the realm of the mad wizard Halaster Blackcloak. The dungeon has 23 levels and a subterranean city.

Pros:
- Exploring a megadungeon is pretty similar to what we've been doing. This is like the PRIMO dungeon crawl
- Although its not really a straight-up campaign with a storyline, there is an overarching goal to work towards which is neat. It isn't JUST 23 levels of "open the door and kill the monsters"; there is a thriving ecosystem.

Cons:
- Hope you like dungeon crawling! Because that's it, baby.

## Random Adventurer's League One-Shots
> Levels: any

Adventurer's League is D&D's Organized Play setting, where WotC publishes official content in individual quest packets. They are meant for playing at official places like game shops, conventions, etc, so they are tailored around NOT having an overarching story of any kind. It is all very standardized, and it is set in the standard Forgotten Realms setting (Waterdeep, Baldur's Gate, etc).

Pros:
- There is a nearly-endless supply of AL content for any level. You can kinda pick and choose whatever suits your mood.

Cons:
- Lots of decisions, as we'd have to pick a new quest every session pretty much.
- No overarching plot of any kind, unless you make one.
- No pre-made roll20 content like maps.

## Rise of Tiamat
> Levels: 8-15

The Cult of Dragons is trying to sew chaos and worship evil dragons. A faction within the cult wants to free Tiamat, the Dragon Queen, from the Nine Hells. There are a number of different factions that do NOT want this to happen, and YOU have to help them stop the "Rise of Tiamat". Do a LOT of traveling around Faerun, do some diplomacy to woo the factions, and fight some dragons. This adventure is a continuation of "Hoard of the Dragon Queen", a level 1-8 adventure.

Pros:
- Starts at the same level that the party died at.
- A council of leaders hires you to stop an evil cult of dragon worshippers? Classic dnd adventure right there.

Cons:
- Skipping Hoard of the Dragon Queen is doable (there is a page in the book about it) but obviously you will miss out on some of the lore and connections.
- Some people say the plot is sort of convoluted. Lots of hard-to-follow political stuff esp. if you don't have existing knowledge of Forgotten Realms (which I do not).
- "A lot of the problems can be fixed by a great DM"... sounds exhausting LOL

## Storm King's Thunder
> Levels 1-11+ (or 5-11+)

The giants have left their homes and are wreaking havoc on the Sword Coast. Investigate the cause of the invasion, harness rune magic, and battle all types of giants. People say this adventure has a feel similar to Lord of the Rings.

Pros:
- Truly an "epic" adventure, have to restore order to the giants that live in the sky.
- Lots of interesting decision points where the story diverges and takes you to different locations.

Cons:
- Lots of traveling (which is usually pretty boring)
- Only goes to level 11

## ⭐️ Ghosts of Saltmarsh
> Levels: 1-12 (Individual adventures starting at 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 11)

A series of adventures (like Tales from the Yawning Portal) with a nautical theme that take place around the port town of Saltmarsh. Pirates, sunken cities, lovecraftian nautical horrors, etc. Includes special rules for sailing and ship-to-ship combat for good ol' pirate action.

Pros:
- Described as "Like Yawning Portal but more user friendly with richer non-adventure content".

Cons:
- No overarching plot connecting the story. More like a series of side quests.

# Thoughts: Mad Mage vs. Storm King

Big question: Do you want to unravel a juicy plot that is happening around you, or discover/create your own plot?

Here is a good quote about Mad Mage and Megadungeons:

> Despite what the name would have you believe, a mega dungeon is not an extra-large dungeon. A dungeon is an adventure. You go there because an NPC told you to, you go from room to room killing all the monsters therein, and at the end you kill the boss and grab the thing that you came there for. And then you leave and never come back. If you run a megadungeon this way, its going to become exactly what you described it as: a huge slog. Killing room-full after room-full of enemies with no end in sight.
> 
> But here’s what a megadungeon can be: think of a dungeon as an adventure and a megadungeon as a campaign setting. The mega dungeon is a place that you return to time and again for different adventures. Its a place where everyone you meet could be an enemy or an ally.  It’s constantly changing and adapting to the party’s actions.

I see Mad Mage as being similar (in a way) to Hot Springs Island. It is a big environment full of different NPCs, factions, events, etc. that are all happening around you. You have some main overarching goal (escape the island/get to the bottom of the dungeon) but mostly you will explore, and create your own goals based on your interactions.

If you don't have a strong character dynamic and motivations, you may struggle to come up with your own interesting adventures and default to just hacking through the dungeon (which is a boring slog).

# Homebrew Ideas

## General Feature Tweaks
- Illiteracy: See Darker Dungeons
- Darkvision nerf

## Class Tweaks
Handle on a case-by-case basis

## Inventory
Do we want to be strict with this or not? I think it creates interesting narrative moments when you have to choose between dropping something, being slow, or leaving loot.

Proposal: Slot based inventory.
- Easier to track than weight-based

Proposal: Wear & Tear
- When you crit fail, add a "notch" to your weapon/spell-focus.
  - Each notch reduced damage die by one size. 10 notches usually breaks
- When you get crit, add a notch to armor
  - Each notch reduces AC by 1
- Sacrifice gear by ignoring notches for 1 roll.
- Repair, temper, resell gear. etc.
- More work to track

## Ammo Tracking
We typically don't do this at all

Options:
- No tracking at all.
- Track each piece individually (most realistic).
- "Ammo dice". Every time you use ammo, roll the die (start at d12). If you roll a 1 or 2, reduce the size of the ammo die (d12 -> d10). If you roll a 1 or 2 on a d4, you only have ONE more piece of ammo.

## Crafting
You may learn recipes for crafting special items. (See Darker Dungeons for example)

## Gemstones/Jewels
A modular way to improve gear

Gemstones have a cut quality that affects value. you can attempt to improve it with jewelers tools.
Gemstones can be converted to arcane jewels with time+effort. They can be socketed into gear to add effects.

Oils are like consumable temporary gemstones.


## Characters:
### Derek
Comes from a wealthy family, but was disinherited. Wants to regain their lost wealth. Thinks of themself as better than everyone, especially the crusty townsfolk of Saltmarsh. Has worked as a sailor to make ends meet. Went to Elf private school with Avelina's character (who is still rich), and is sticking to them because of the potential to make money again.

- Flaw: overconfidence
- Bond: Friendship, disinherited by family
- Ideals: Hypercapitalist. Out of touch with saltmarsh culture.

### Avelina
Wealthy elf jerk who sees a lot of opportunity in Saltmarsh. Wants to establish a lucrative arms contract with the kingdom, so is seeking to establish roots here and acquire reputation. Kind of a busy body, and looks down on the people that get in their way.

- Ideals: Everyone should be self-made
- Flaw: Feel guilty about being raised rich.

### Mac
A rough-and-tumble lizardperson captain-for-hire. Has a long past on the seas, and does not engage in piracy. Has plenty of wealth amassed, but seeks adventure, and to take out some of the more dangerous pirate factions. Sees Avelina's character's ventures as a ripe opportunity for adventure and a stable source of entertainment. Has worked in the past to help Morgan's character with their pirate-on-pirate crime. Also sometimes enlists Phil's character for anti-pirate shenanigans.

Flaw/bond: willing to work on credit out of a love for adventure, has many debtors around town. impulsive, shortsighted. ideal: hard work pays off, compatible with early capitalism, incompatible with late capitalism as work should equate to power

Morgan
Washed up on the shores, and was ostracized by the ignorant townfolk for being an elf (?). The sea was their only companion, and now commands swarms of squid. Lurks the seas to prey upon vulnerable ships to claim their bounties. See's Avelina's character's ventures as a way to create a NEW Saltmarsh that is accepting.

- Flaws: Desperate for respect. impulsive
- Ideals: Value money and power above other things.
- Bonds:

Phil
Has a deep-seated hatred of pirates and theft. Tends to side with the loyalists as they are cracking down on the pirates as well.

- Bond: 
- Ideals: Hate theft. Earn what you have fair and square.
- Flaw: Illiterate. Tough outer shell.
