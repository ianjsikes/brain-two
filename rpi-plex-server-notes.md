# RPi Plex Server Notes

[[computers]]

Notes on steps taken to setup Raspberry Pi as a Plex media server.

- Format SD card and install Raspbian using Raspberry Pi Imager
- Hook it up to monitor & keyboard to do initial setup of wifi and ssh
  - It should be possible to skip this by adding a `ssh` file and a `wpa_supplicant.conf`
    in the sd card root, but I had trouble getting it working.
- Upgrade stuff
- Configure external hard drive [link](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-mount-usb-drive/) [other link](https://medium.com/@aallan/adding-an-external-disk-to-a-raspberry-pi-and-sharing-it-over-the-network-5b321efce86a)
