# Kingdom of Keoland

King: Kimbertos Skotti

Was a formidable military power with cavalry and knights. Pushed north, east, and west. The south is a coastal border that was neglected. Crime and piracy ran rampant. The bordering kingdoms started pushing back, and Keoland couldn't expand anymore. The king struck up treaties with the bordering nations and raised a navy. The king declared a war against the pirates and crushed the Sea Princes. He hoped to grow the region as a center for trade.
