# Crabber's Cove

- East of the docks, a handful of weathered abandoned buildings.
- Thousands of crabs have occupied it.
- **Rumor:** More than one fisher has disappeared into it.
- Unknown to Saltmarsh, a vampire named Xolec is trapped in a cellar.
  - Buried in an ancient tomb, but a trader brought the coffin to Saltmarsh and opened it.
  - Confronted by a cleric of St. Cuthbert but could only trap him with a curse.
  - Can only leave if carried by someone pure of heart.
- [[scarlet-brotherhood]] agents use the cabin above Xolec for meetings.
  - Xolec knows the full details of their operation and [[skerrin-wavechaser]]'s role.
  - Will trade this information for his freedom if confronted by adventurers.
