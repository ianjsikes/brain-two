**Personality:** Curt and quick, but gives everyone a fair accounting. Nobody's fool.

**Ideal:** Curiosity and hard work. Relentless about a topic she is interested in. Obstacles don't slow her down.
**Bond:** Intensly loyal to dwaves and the mining operation. Threats to her livelihood earn her wrath.
**Flaw:** No patience. Pushes for quick results over a measured approach.
