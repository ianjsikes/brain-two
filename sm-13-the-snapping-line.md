# The Snapping Line

Built from old fishing ships. Nautical decor. Sleeping rooms are ship cabins. Smells like fish.

Sailors gather to trade stories and drink. Run by [[hanna-rist]].

Make a liquor out of lobster meat and potatoes called **Claw Wine** (an acquired taste).

Employs several former dockhands to keep peace.
