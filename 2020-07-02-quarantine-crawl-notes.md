# 2020-07-02 Quarantine Crawl Notes

Session Notes for [[quarantine-crawl]]

For the traveling, I used [Giffyglyph's Darker Dungeons travel rules][darker]. I used the Tombs of Annihilation random tables for encounters. It worked alright but nobody really liked it.

## Summary

Party starts on the northern coast of Chult. They begin their journey inwards. Soon they encounter Koh (Luke), stuck in a trap hanging by his feet. They cut him down. Koh has no memories (...) and decides to join the party for no reason. They keep traveling. Pretty much uneventful ~5 days of travel. They get swarmed by bats in the night once.

They arrive at the ruined city of Tamoachan. They fall in a pit. Koh steals some tiny gold bits from a diorama. They encounter a crayfish guardian. Ugen uses tongues to speak to it in Ancient Olman. It talks a big talk to stay away, but the party dashes past for the door behind it. The door is buried in mud, so they have to kill the guardian and its Hermit Crab friend as well. They finally blast the door open and hear an ominous melody... TO BE CONTINUED.
