# DnD 5e GM Tips

## Dungeon Crawling

Perception = Senses, could train an animal to do it
Investigation = Sherlock holmes, requires a clue or a hunch or hypothesis

## Combat

Remember to do stuff other than _just attack_ each round. Ready actions if situation is not currently ideal. Push/grapple/disarm.

## Magic Items

> The identify spell is the fastest way to reveal an item’s properties. Alternatively, a character can focus on one magic item during a short rest, while being in physical contact with the item. At the end of the rest, the character learns the item’s properties, as well as how to use them. Potions are an exception; a little taste is enough to tell the taster what the potion does.
>
> Sometimes a magic item carries a clue to its properties. The command word to activate a ring might be etched in tiny letters inside it, or a feathered design might suggest it’s a ring of feather falling.
>
> Wearing or experimenting with an item can also offer hints about its properties. For example, if a character puts on a ring of jumping, you could say, “Your steps feel strangely springy.” Perhaps the character then jumps up and down to see what happens. You then say the character jumps unexpectedly high.
