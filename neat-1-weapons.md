The vines grow over 1minute up to a maximum height of 50 feet, and climbing them takes no check unless done hastily, in which case the climber still has advantage on checks made to climb them. Retrieving the weapon takes an action and causes the vines to wilt and disappear after 1 minute.

### Warrior's Light (Greatsword)

### Wind Hammer (Maul)

The enchantment placed upon this large, two-handed hammer makes it nearly weightless until right before a strike connects. This makes it much more wieldy and allows for more momentum in the strikes, giving its wielder a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Duelist's Pen (Rapier)

This odd rapier looks like an oversized ink pen attached to a hilt and hand guard. It is nonetheless an effective weapon, giving its wielder a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. In addition, its wielder can use the rapier to write on surfaces without damaging them. When used on surfaces other than paper, the writing fades after 1 hour, otherwise it lasts as long as regular ink. The rapier allows for enough writing precision for the wearer to use their regular handwriting, even on large surfaces.

### Desert Dancer (Scimitar)

This beautifully decorated scimitar is adorned with long red ribbons of silk, that seem to move in accordance with the wielder's intentions. This impressive and distracting display makes it easier to strike enemies, giving the wielder a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

### Poisoner's Shortsword (Shortsword)

This finely crafted shortsword contains a mechanism that can be used to store poison and later swiftly coat the blade with them. It gives its wielder a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. In addition, the wielder can use an action to store a poison within the sword. A poison stored in this way does not dry until used. When a poison is stored in the blade in this way, the wielder can decide to apply it to the blade as part of an attack, instead of having to use an action to do so. All other normal rules for poison apply. Only one poison can be stored in the sword at a time.

It gives its wielder a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. In addition, when struck against a wall, it gives off a low vibrating hum when a secret door is within 30 feet on the same wall, and a loud echoing sound when a secret door is hit directly.

### Acrobat's Rope (Whip)

This silky whip has a small hook on its end. It gives its wielder a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. In addition, when falling or jumping, its wielder can use its reaction to make an attack roll against an object within range.

## Ranged

### Shrike (Crossbow, lig⁠ht)

This crossbow is used by scouts and infiltrators to help them survey their surroundings. It gives its wielder a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

The bird has AC 13, 1 HP, a fly speed of 30 feet and a +1 bonus to Wisdom (Perception) checks. The wielder can then use another bonus action to call the bird back, which lands in its wearer's hands and turns back into a crossbow. While in flight, the bird can make Wisdom (Perception) checks to survey its surroundings, but it must return to its wearer to communicate any sort of information.
If the bird is killed, it reverts to its crossbow form and drops down, and the crossbow cannot transform into a bird again for a week.

### Messenger's Dart (Dart)

This well crafted dart is used to deliver messages without being seen. It gives its wielder a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

The written message cannot appear on creatures, and stays on the surface for 1 minute before fading.

### Tracker's Shortbow (Shortbow)

This light shortbow has a bowstring made out of spider silk. It gives its wielder a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. In addition, when its wielder hits a creature with an arrow fired from this weapon, they can choose to spin an ethereal tread that connects the bow to the creature hit. The thread is intangible and invisible to everyone but the wielder, who can follow it to infallibly track the creature hit. The thread lasts until the creature moves more than a mile away from the wielder, or it is severed by a magical slashing weapon.
The weapon can only have 3 threads attached to it at any time. If a new one is created when the weapon already has 3 threads attached, the oldest one snaps immediately.

### Trickster's Eyepatch (Sling)

This sling bears an enchantment that makes it strike true more often, giving its wielder a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

When used in this way, it doesn't impede vision and is indistinguishable from a regular eyepatch, unless the observer can detect magic or see through illusions.

### Vandal's Blowgun (Blowgun)

This curious blowgun carved out of reed is more effective than usual as a weapon, giving its wielder a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. In addition, any projectile fired from this weapon will stick on hard surfaces, until they fall off naturally 24 hours later or are removed with a successful DC 10 Strength check.

In addition, when firing a bolt from this crossbow, the wielder can choose to have it emit a loud sound that deals no damage but can be heard up to 300 feet away.

### Inky Longbow (Longbow)

This bow is one of many used by guards of a certain community to mark fleeing criminals from afar. It gives its wielder a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. In addition, when the wielder hits a creature with an arrow fired from this weapon, they can choose to imprint a large, tattoo-like mark on the creature hit, which typically appears near the neck and across the jaw, instead of dealing damage. This mark lasts for a month and cannot be removed by any means other than a Remove Curse spell.
The mark can still be hidden with mundane means or illusion spells, and a creature affected by the mark that changes form (such as with the Wild Shape feature or spells like Alter Self or Polymorph) can choose to not have the mark appear on its new form, however the mark reappears as soon as the creature returns to its original form.

### Sure Catch (Net)

This net that always smells faintly of fish is very easy to throw, giving its wielder a +1 bonus to attack rolls made with this weapon. In addition, the net doesn't impose disadvantage when thrown at long range, and it can hit a creature at long range even underwater.
