# Danger at Dunwater

## Tips
- Best if PCs are unsure if lizardfolk are hostile or friendly. Err on the side of friendly.
  

## Rumors
- The lizardfolk are arming themselves using stolen weapons from the kingdom of Keoland.
- Lizardfolk are not typically raiders or invaders. They stay in their own territory and are largely isolationist.
- It is not unheard of for lizardfolk to trade with other humanoid races.
- Saltmarsh has seen no lizardfolk scouts scouting out the town.
- The lizardfolk of Dunwater haven't always been there. They arrived there as refugees from somewhere else.
- Ships from the west report of being attacked by "sea devils" who are likely not lizardfolk.
