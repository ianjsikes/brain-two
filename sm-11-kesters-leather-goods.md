# Kester's Leather Goods

A tannery that produces smooth, colorful leather for every purpose. Owned by [[kiorna-kester]].

**HOOK:** Kiorna is interested in acquiring hides from exotic creatures. Pays a fee equal to 100 times the creature's CR for intact hide of CR 3 or higher. Harvesting the hide requires an intact carcass, an hour of work, and a DC 15 Dex (sleight of hand) or Wis (Survival) check to preserve it. On a failed check, does not meet her standards but could be sold for a lower price.
