# Dreadwood

- Home to monsters and raiders
- Patrolled by Keoish rangers
- Wood elf clans live on the edges.
- Deep inside, the Material and Shadowfell overlap.
- At its center is an ancient hag named Granny Nightshade
  - As powerful as a mighty wizard
  - Deal with dukes of the nine hells
  - Lies in her fortress, Castle Spiral
