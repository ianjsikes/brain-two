# Mining HQ

Previously a mansion owned by a noble. Purchased by crown. Now the Dwarven Mining Company's HQ.

[[manistrad-copperlocks]] stays here sometimes, and several dwarf clerks work here, logging deliveries and arranging for ore processing.

Rumors of a vault hidden underneath. In the cellar, a heavy iron door (DC 25 Dex). Keep about 1,000 gp in coins and gems. Guarded by 4 suits of animated armor and a rug of smothering in the vault. Can be disabled with the command word "Tatalot". Manistrad and her advisors know the word.
