# Carpenters' Guildhall

- Run by [[jilar-kankleston]]
- Plenty of work building houses, barrels, docks, etc.
- The building is a marvel of workmanship, not a single nail.
- **HOOK:** Jilar will pay handsomely for expeditions in search of specific trees in the Hool Marshes, Drowned Forest, and the Dreadwood. (See table)
