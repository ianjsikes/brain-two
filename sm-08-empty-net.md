# Empty Net

A rickety tavern on stilts over the water. A haven for smugglers/assassins/pirates. Owned by [[kreb-shenker]].

Takes money from anyone, no questions asked. Troublemakers are thrown into the harbor. Good place for a rowdy night of drinking and brawling. The guard only comes here if called.
